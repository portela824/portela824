<h1 align="left">Hi👋, I'm José G. Portela</h1>

### 
Biostatistician, mathematician, and data analyst passionate about public health, equity, and transforming data into actionable solutions. As someone living with epilepsy, I am a lifelong learner with a deep interest in epilepsy-related conditions, data-driven public health topics, and the mathematical concepts that underpin them. I'm also intellectually curious beyond my field, with a particular appreciation for historical topics as a lens to understand broader social and scientific contexts.
